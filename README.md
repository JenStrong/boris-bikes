# Boris Bikes 

### [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) - Week 1 Pair Programming Project

## Outline
Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## The Task
I used this project to practice TDD and OOP. I used the User Stories that are liste below to determine which Objects and Methods I needed to create. After creating the needed Objects and Methods, I wrote feature tests (tested using IRB) and followed up with unit tests (tested using RSpec). The goal making all RSPEC tests pass by the end of the project was achieved.
