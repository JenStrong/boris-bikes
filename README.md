# Boris Bikes 

## Outline
Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## The Task
Throughout the course of the project we weâ€™re given several User Stories which are listed below. We started to determine which parts of the User Story are Objects and which are Methods. As in all TDD we created a test for a feature that we wanted to manipulate and then wrote the code to pass those tests.
